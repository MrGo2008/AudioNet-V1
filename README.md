One dimensional CNN based classifier for Speech Commands Dataset


## One Dimensional CNN

Since speech signal is single dimensional, Convolutional neural nets with 1-D convolutions are used to classify the speech signal. The dataset used is Google's peech Commands Dataset

The network has five convolutional layers with kernel size 32 and stride of 4. They are followed by four hidden layers with 512 neurons each.
